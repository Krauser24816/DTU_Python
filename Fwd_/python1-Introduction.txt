What is Python::
................

* Python is a cross-platform programming language, meaning, it runs on multiple platforms like Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Unix and has even been ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines. 

* It is free and open source.

* Even though most of today’s Linux and Mac have Python preinstalled in it, the version might be out-of-date. 
* So, it is always a good idea to install the most current version. You can download the latest version of Python and install it.

		   How to install the Python??_________________________________________________________________________


Download and install Python:
............................
1. to download python go to www.python.org and download the python latest version of python 3.7.1 as cmpatible for you computer system.

2. install by clicking next next and python will be installed.


There are various ways to start Python.

1. Intermediate mode-

Typing python in the command line will invoke the interpreter in immediate mode. We can directly type in Python expressions and press enter to get the output.

2. Script mode-
This mode is used to execute Python program written in a file. Such a file is called a script. Scripts can be saved to disk for future use. Python scripts have the extension .py, meaning that the filename ends with .py.
To execute this file in script mode we simply write python helloWorld.py at the command prompt.


3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)-
We can use any text editing software to write a Python script file.
We just need to save it with the .py extension. But using an IDE can make our life a lot easier. IDE is a piece of software that provides useful features like code hinting, syntax highlighting and checking, file explorers etc. to the programmer for application development.

 History of Python:: 

1. python is a general purpose high level programming language.
2. GUIDO VAN ROSSAM developed python in 1990 while working at national reasearch institute at neitherland, but officilly made available in 1991.
3. c,c++, java are statically typed programming language wether, Python is dynamically typed programming language.

why the name is python??

In 1969-1974 there was the best funny show BBC(british broadcosting company ) where Monty Pythons's circus is a very fuunny show and people were addicted for that show.

Bacause of this python name is came to known.
Python programming borrowed most of the features from another programming language-
	1. functional Programming from- c language
	2. object oriented programming from = c++ Programming
	3. scripting language- from shell script and perl language
	4. modular programming language from- Modula-3
	
Most of the syntax borrowed from C language and ABC language.

Features of Python::

1. It is simple and easy to learn.
	1. Length of the code is very less.
       	2. Readability is more easy.
2. Python is open-source and free -ware.
3.It is high level Programming Language.
4.*Plateform Independent
5.*Portable  
6.*****Dynamically typed
7.Both procedure oriented and object Oriented
8.Interpreted
9.******Extensible
10.*****Embedded
11.*********Rich Libraries


_________________________________________________________________________

Core Python is mainly used in developing machine leraning, AI and IoT application and also we can consider the main use of Python in developing the window based application.  
_________________________________________________________________________
  
1.  Easy-to-learn: Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a cle arly defined syntax. This allows a student to pick up the language quickly.  
   
 2.  Easy-to-read: Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.  
  
3.  Easy-to-maintain: Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.  

4. A broad standard library: Python's bulk of the library is very portable and crossplatform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.  
  
5.  Interactive Mode: Python has support for an interactive mode, which all ows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.  
  
6.   Portable: Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has  the same interface on all platforms.   

Extendable: You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add or customize their tools to be more efficient.  

7. Databases: Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.  

8. GUI Programming: Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.  

9. Scalable: Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.

Limitation of Python::
........................

1. Performance wise pyhton is not upto the mark because of Interpreted.
2. dosen't support mobile application.



======================
Myth: python is not suitable for large sacle application.


Flavors of Python:
...................

1. c-Python= It is used for the c-language code with Pyhton. standard flavour of Python.

2.JPython or Jython= This python is developed to work with the java Programming.

3.IronPython= This python is developed to work with the microsoft( c# and .net) Programming Language.

4.Pypy= pis python fr speed, inside python virtual machine internally JIT compiler is working which improves the performance.

5. RubyPython= it can be used for the ruby platform, for ruby based application.

6. anacondaPython= It is used for the big-data handling we go for anaconda. As to handle hugev data  with the big-data and hadoop.

7. stackless(Python for concurrency)- Parrallely  the things executed so for this purpose we use stackless Python.

Versions of Python--

Python 1.0 = jan 1994
Python 2.0 =october 2000
Python 3.0 = dec 2008

as new version should provide support for old program.

Python-3 is recommended to use beacuse python-2 is used only for the 2020 after that python-2 would not b available in the market by the python org.


print "hello"   ///valid in python-2 but not in python-3

print ("hello")  //python-3


long datatype dosn't supported by python-3.

Python Memory Management:

1. Memory management in python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. The programmer does not have access to this private heap. The python interpreter takes care of this instead.
2. The allocation of heap space for Python objects is done by Python’s memory manager. The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.
3. Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the unused memory and so that it can be made available to the heap space.

_________________________________________________________________________
Identifier:: The name which can be used for identification purpose that name in python program is known as identifier.

x=10
def f1():
class Test(Exception):


##variable name,class name or method name is known as identifier.

1. alphabate sybols( both upper_case and lower_case).
	cash=10
	ca$h=10

2. Identifier should not starts with digits.
   total123=10
   123total=10

3. ifdentifier are case-sensitive, we can't use reserved words as the identifier.

    x=10
    y=20

4. there is no length limit in declaring variable.


_name= means this variable is defined as the private.
__id= means this variable is defined as protected.

__class__ = means language defined special name. this is specially defined for the constructor only.
