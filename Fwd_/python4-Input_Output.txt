Input-Output

if i want to read the data dynamic from the keyboard .... what we will do??


in python 2::
..............

there are two function available....
 1. x=raw_input(" enter the number")
 2. y=input("entr the number")

what is diffrence between both of them......

 x=raw_input(" enter the number")
     means it takes only string data compulsory we have to required typcasting function.

  y=input("entr the number")
       it is not consider as str type what every type provided we are not required typecasting.


Python-3
..............
in python 3 there is only-
 x=input("enter the number")

and it is more similar to the raw_input so it is compulsory for type_casting the variable.


x=int(input("entr the st number"))
y=(input("enter the scnd nmbr"))
z=x+y
print (z)

print() is a function which is used to print the statement in python program.

form-1:
  
print- without any arguments
   It is used when you want to print line seprator then this print function is used.


print("helloo")
print("hiii")
print
print("hppp")

 

print("helloo \n shweta")     ///for new line
print("hiii \t rajnii")      // for tab space

print(string)
+ ==> both argument should be string
*==>  one argument should be string and another should be int. 


print("helloo"+" hemaa")     // for concatenation
print("shweta"*3)   //for repeatation


print("abc"+"cdf")    => no space is avaialable between two strings
print("abc","def")    => space are available in this line

Python Import-

When our program grows bigger, it is a good idea to break it into different modules.
A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. Python modules have a filename and end with the extension .py.
Definitions inside a module can be imported to another module or the interactive interpreter in Python. We use the import keyword to do this.

For example, we can import the math module by typing in import math.
