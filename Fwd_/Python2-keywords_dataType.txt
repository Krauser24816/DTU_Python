   Reserved words(Keywords)
...............................................
  In Python, keywords are case sensitive.
 There are 33 reserved keywords in the Python.

true,false,none(null),and, or,not,is,if,else,elif (switch statement is not avalble in python),while, for,break, (do-while is not available in python) continue,return,in ,yield, try,except, finally, raise,assert, import,from, as, class, def, pass, global, non-local, lambda, del, with


assert keyword is used for debugging purpose.
print is python defined function not a keyword.


..........................................
Note::

1. all reserved keywords are the alphabate symbols.

similar, for the keywords if we use as a data specification the error will be occurred.

::::::::::
  to know the keywords we can use as- 
 	import keyword
	 keyword.kwlist


['and', 'as', 'assert', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'exec', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'print', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']

Python Indentation:

Most of the programming languages like C, C++, Java use braces { } to define a block of code. Python uses indentation.

A code block (body of a function, loop etc.) starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line. The amount of indentation is up to you, but it must be consistent throughout that block.

Generally, four whitespaces are used for indentation and is preferred over tabs. Here is an example.

 for i in range(1,11):
    
        print(i)
    
        if i == 5:
        
            break

Variable:

In most of the programming languages a variable is a named location used to store data in the memory. 

Each variable must have a unique name called identifier. 

Variables are similar as container that hold data which can be changed later throughout programming.


for ex- you can suppose, variable as a bag to store books in it and those books can be replaced at anytime.
 In Python we don't assign values to the variables, whereas Python gives the reference of the object (value) to the variable.


........................................................................

In Python, variables do not need declaration to reserve memory space. The "variable declaration" or "variable initialization" happens automatically when we assign a value to a variable.


name="shweta"
print(name)

Python is a type inferred language, it can automatically infer (know)shweta is a String and declare name as a String.

Data-Type::
................................................

Python is dynamically typed progrmming language.

 1. to represent whole value -
   int, float, there is also complex data type it the best choice to choose the Python.

In python various inbuilt data-types are-

int, float, complex, bool, str, bytes, bytearray, range, list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, none.

Python provides some inbuilt function also-
as:
1.  print() is a function that is used for printing something.
2.  type() defines the type of the datatype.

 example- 
        a=20
	print(a)
        type(a)

Note**- In python everything is an object. 


1. int: the number without decimal point, those value aare consider under the int data type.
        a=20
	print(a)
        type(a)   //<class,'int'>

this means that int is a class.

long is used for taking large data in int form, but in python long data-type dosnt supported.


2. str

Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (""" or """ for multi-line) quotes to denote string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.


   print('shweta')  //char
   print("shweta")  // string
   print("""shweta chauhan """)    //


3. float:
 the value which is taken as the decimal values are comes uder the float value.
	a=2.3
	print(a)    ///2.3
	type(a)     ////<type 'float'>



4. bool- this is the data type which is used to take only true and false value.
         a=True
         True+True     ///2
         


5. List-  List is an ordered sequence of items. It is one of the most used datatype in Python and is very flexible. All the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.
Declaring a list is pretty straight forward. Items separated by commas are enclosed within brackets [ ]

	a = [1, 2.2, 'python']
	print (a)
	type(a)


6. Tuple- Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as list.The only difference is that tuples are immutable. Tuples once created cannot be modified.
Tuples are used to write-protect data and are usually faster than list as it cannot change dynamically.
It is defined within parentheses () where items are separated by commas.

		a=(5,'program', 1+3j)
		print (a)
		type(a)


7. Set- Set is an unordered collection of unique items. Set is defined by values separated by comma inside braces { }. Items in a set are not ordered.

		a = {5,2,3,1,4}
		print(a)
		type(a)

8. Dictionary- Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
It is generally used when we have a huge amount of data. Dictionaries are optimized for retrieving data. We must know the key to retrieve the value.
In Python, dictionaries are defined within braces {} with each item being a pair in the form key:value. Key and value can be of any type.

		d = {1:'value','key':2}
		print(a)
		type(a)
.........................................................................
There is no need to define the the size and type of the data-type. 

a=10
print a
name="shweta"
print a
marks=67.8
print marks
type(a)
type(name)
type(marks)



Note**-
we can't use keywords for the data specification.
example- 
	a=true
	if we write this true keyword as data specification an error will be occurred as
NameError: name 'true' is not defined


_________________________________________________________________________
 comments:

# is used to define the single line comment in the python.

  #helloo
  print("python")

""".....""" is used to define the multi-line comment in pyhton.

'''    print(c)
	print(sub)
	print(mul)
	print(div)  '''

Type conversion
...........................................
We can convert between different data types by using different type conversion functions like int(), float(), str() etc.
		
			a=20
			float(a)
			str(a)

1. int(): This function converts any data type to integer. ‘Base’ specifies the base in which string is if data type is string.

2. float(): This function is used to convert any data type to a floating point number.

3. ord() : This function is used to convert a character to integer.
4. hex() : This function is to convert integer to hexadecimal string.

5. oct() : This function is to convert integer to octal string.

6. tuple() : This function is used to convert to a tuple.

7. set() : This function returns the type after converting to set.

8. list() : This function is used to convert any data type to a list type.


__________________________________________________________________________

** Note:
      1.  Type Conversion is the conversion of object from one data type to another data type.
      2.  Type Conversion is automatically performed by the Python interpreter.
      3.  Python avoids the loss of data in Implicit Type Conversion.
      
      4. Explicit Type Conversion is also called Type Casting, the data types of object are converted using predefined function by user.
       
      5.  In Type Casting loss of data may occur as we enforce the object to specific data type.
